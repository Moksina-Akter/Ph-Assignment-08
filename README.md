# AppStore UI Project

This project is a fully responsive AppStore UI built with React. It includes Home, All Apps, App Details, and My Installation pages. Users can view app information, download count, average ratings, and reviews. The Install button saves apps to LocalStorage and disables if already installed. The Installation page allows uninstalling apps with live UI updates. Features include live search, sorting by downloads, loading animations during page navigation and search, custom header and footer, and responsive Recharts visualizations for reviews. All routes handle errors and invalid URLs gracefully.
